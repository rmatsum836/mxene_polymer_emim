# MXENE Polymer and EMIM-TFSI Simulations

A collection of scripts and files to simulate MXenes filled with
tetraalkylammonium polymers and EMIM cations.  The mBuild recipe to build the MXene lattice compounds is currently private.  However the GROMACS input files are contained to run the simulations

## Requirements
- mBuild
- Foyer
- MXenes GitHub Repository (Currently Private)
- ILForcefields
- MDTraj
- MDAnalysis
